            <h3><a href="http://whatsmystylepersonality.com/"> Whats my style Personality></a></h3>
               <p>This website is clean sleek and mapped out nicely. I like how the pages smoothly slide into eachother. The color scheme and the Text are chosen very nicely. When i took the survey i got Urban, with my spirit animal as a wolf. Its a cute a fun interactive site for mature fashionista.

            <h3><a href="http://sparetime.arkivert.no/en">How much is your time worth?</a></h3>
               <p>This website is fun becasue of how interactive it is. Another survey website, however it entire interface is plauful and fun. After completing the fun interactive tasks i found out my spare time is only worth $49 a hour. This website is fun plug for finding a gardener, carpenter, or a painter. this is one of my favorite simple interactive sites.
