            <h3><a href="https://neave.tv/">Neave.Tv</a></h3>
               <p>This websites peeked my interest. Its only use seems to be of pure visonary entertainment. I used to watch ADD TV on Bcat when i was younger, where it was 30 mins of random video clips. So this remind me very much of that show but much creepyier and funner.

               <p> Arcade Fires Song Neon bible, is designed as an interactive Magic music video. This website is playful and engages the user to click aorund to see what what happends. I like this site because of the creative idea to make and interactive music video. I have never seen anything like it before.
