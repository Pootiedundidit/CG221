        <h2> &star; <u> Week One Feb.1.2017 </u> &star;</h2>
            <h3><a href="http://ducksarethebest.com/">Ducks are the best</a></h3>
               <p> I find the interface of this website quite fun. Drawing is somthing im fond of, so naturally drawing with ducks can be interesting. I find the idea of a Cursors movment to be the paint brush really intriguing.

            <h3><a href="http://www.koalastothemax.com/">Koalas to the max</a></h3>

               <p>I found this website interesting because at first when I clicked around I was not sure what the site was doing. The colorful circle multiplying intomore colors and circles was interesting. Upon playing wit it further i relized the end product is a picture of a koala.

         <h2> &star; <u> Week Two Feb.8.2017 </u> &star;</h2>

            <h3><a href="https://superteamdeluxe.com/">Super Team Deluxe</a></h3>
              <p>As a huge fan on enamel pins, I find the design of this website very pleasing. The color scheme is calm and clean. The interaction when you click a previewed item is designed nicely. Super Team Deluxe’s website is very simple making the interaction on this website very easygoing.

             <h3><a href="http://seikoangelo.com/">Seiko Angelo</a></h3>

           <p> I really enjoyed this site because of the way its interaction is set up.  I like how when you hover over links the eyeball on the face moves. The Website is a portfolio of their work. split into two sides. one side of their consumer ad work, and another of their work in healthcare ads. The design is simple making it easy on the eye. But my only issue with the design is that the site is all under one URL, making going back a little confusing. I think it is an important thing in a site to be able to feel comfortable navigating through a site. if the entire page and its contents it open are running on one page link it can be a little confusing.

          <h2> &star; <u> Week Three Feb.15.2017 </u> &star;</h2>
           
            <h3><a href="http://www.thefamilybusinesstattoo.com/">The Family Buisness Tattoo</a></h3>
              <p>I have an interest in tattoos, and I find many shops pages to be all over the place and just plain old messy. When I discovered this site, I found it very likable. The toolbar is simple and has all go to information without it being too wordy. Each artist had their own portfolio on this site, when you click on the portfolio it leads you to a clear designed slide of all the artists work. The colors are coordinated well with the text so even though it is grey on grey when the text is black it lets you know what page you are currently on. I enjoy how the pages toolbar changes and simplifies as you scroll down so it is not large and distracting to the visitor.

           <h3><a href="https://www.catbirdnyc.com/">Catbird NYC</a></h3>
              <p>Catbird nyc is a local jewelry shop, their website is clean and bright. I enjoy the straightforwardness to the sight everything is organized and easily accessible. One of my favorite features of the site is when you hover over the toolbar logo, an icon pops up beside it saying “surprise me” when clicked, it links you to any random item sold on their site. The gallery for each item for sale is laid out easy to navigate rather than clicking around to see if there is any more images for the item. The zoom is built in so when the cursor hovers over a image it will zoom in. it also changes the cursor making it easier to understand what effect your cursor is having when hovered over the image.
