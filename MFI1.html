        <h2> &star; <u> Week One Feb.1.2017 </u> &star;</h2>
            <h3><a href="http://ducksarethebest.com/">Ducks are the best</a></h3>
               <p> I find the interface of this website quite fun. Drawing is somthing im fond of, so naturally drawing with ducks can be interesting. I find the idea of a Cursors movment to be the paint brush really intriguing.

            <h3><a href="http://www.koalastothemax.com/">Koalas to the max</a></h3>

               <p>I found this website interesting because at first when I clicked around I was not sure what the site was doing. The colorful circle multiplying intomore colors and circles was interesting. Upon playing wit it further i relized the end product is a picture of a koala.

         <h2> &star; <u> Week Two Feb.8.2017 </u> &star;</h2>

            <h3><a href="https://superteamdeluxe.com/">Super Team Deluxe</a></h3>
              <p>As a huge fan on enamel pins, I find the design of this website very pleasing. The color scheme is calm and clean. The interaction when you click a previewed item is designed nicely. Super Team Deluxeâ€™s website is very simple making the interaction on this website very easygoing.

             <h3><a href="http://seikoangelo.com/">Seiko Angelo</a></h3>

           <p> I really enjoyed this site because of the way its interaction is set up.  I like how when you hover over links the eyeball on the face moves. The Website is a portfolio of their work. split into two sides. one side of their consumer ad work, and another of their work in healthcare ads. The design is simple making it easy on the eye. But my only issue with the design is that the site is all under one URL, making going back a little confusing. I think it is an important thing in a site to be able to feel comfortable navigating through a site. if the entire page and its contents it open are running on one page link it can be a little confusing.
