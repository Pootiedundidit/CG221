            <h3><a href="http://ducksarethebest.com/">Ducks are the best</a></h3>
               <p> I find the interface of this website quite fun. Drawing is somthing im fond of, so naturally drawing with ducks can be interesting. I find the idea of a Cursors movment to be the paint brush really intriguing.

            <h3><a href="http://www.koalastothemax.com/">Koalas to the max</a></h3>

               <p>I found this website interesting because at first when I clicked around I was not sure what the site was doing. The colorful circle multiplying intomore colors and circles was interesting. Upon playing wit it further i relized the end product is a picture of a koala.

            <h3><a href="https://superteamdeluxe.com/">Super Team Deluxe</a></h3>
              <p>As a huge fan on enamel pins, I find the design of this website very pleasing. The color scheme is calm and clean. The interaction when you click a previewed item is designed nicely. Super Team Deluxeâ€™s website is very simple making the interaction on this website very easygoing.
