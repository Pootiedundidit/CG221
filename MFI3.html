            <h3><a href="http://www.thefamilybusinesstattoo.com/">The Family Buisness Tattoo</a></h3>
              <p>I have an interest in tattoos, and I find many shops pages to be all over the place and just plain old messy. When I discovered this site, I found it very likable. The toolbar is simple and has all go to information without it being too wordy. Each artist had their own portfolio on this site, when you click on the portfolio it leads you to a clear designed slide of all the artists work. The colors are coordinated well with the text so even though it is grey on grey when the text is black it lets you know what page you are currently on. I enjoy how the pages toolbar changes and simplifies as you scroll down so it is not large and distracting to the visitor.

           <h3><a href="https://www.catbirdnyc.com/">Catbird NYC</a></h3>
              <p>Catbird nyc is a local jewelry shop, their website is clean and bright. I enjoy the straightforwardness to the sight everything is organized and easily accessible. One of my favorite features of the site is when you hover over the toolbar logo, an icon pops up beside it saying “surprise me” when clicked, it links you to any random item sold on their site. The gallery for each item for sale is laid out easy to navigate rather than clicking around to see if there is any more images for the item. The zoom is built in so when the cursor hovers over a image it will zoom in. it also changes the cursor making it easier to understand what effect your cursor is having when hovered over the image.
