               <p>This website is really interesting to me. The layout is bland and pretty basic, How ever the content is fun and playful. Who wouldnt want to pull up the top Songs from that year you graduated high school just to get  a blast from the past. Although fairly unpleasent to the eye this website is still very simply done and user friendly.

               <p>As an artist, i enjoy abstract art very much. This website creates any image that you upload into a simple abstract peiece of art. The playful name makes a user want to go to the website.
