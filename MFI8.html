               <p>I really enjoy this site. The random images being generated as you clicks really catches my attention. The song plays in a loop giving this website and endless feel. I enjoy digital art very much, and this website really captures everything i enjoy about digital art, like the weird feeling you get at the collage or images.

               <p> This website is simple, but very entertaining. Every click engages the user to find something new. You pull off the nose to reveal a different nose each time. The eye will cry if you click it, and then comes rolling out the mouth. This website is very strange. However i find it very fun and interactive.
