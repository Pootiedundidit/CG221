          <br> My name is Pootie, I am 23 years old, born and raised in Brooklyn N.Y. I am currently in between majors at FIT. I have just completed my Fine Arts AAS and now i am seeking a degree with Computer Animation and Interactive Design.
          <br>I work as a seasonal Store Manager at a pop up halloween store. Although it is very stressful, I do enjoy my job. It’s challenging and even through the chaos and madness I come out with a smile.
          <br>Computers have always been a prominent part of my life. When I began surfing the Web back in the early 2000’s I always had an interest in the design of websites. When myspace was popular way back in 2004, I made it my intent to create appealing layouts for my page. I loved customizing my page to show how creative. Little did I know, the HTML coding I was using are imperative skills to my understanding of web design.
